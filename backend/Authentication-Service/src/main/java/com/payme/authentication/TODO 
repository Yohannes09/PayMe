GENERAL:
- Massive rework, specifically, validation logic
  and separation of concerns.
- Fix naming of variables, and classes.
- Remove unused services, entities, etc.
- Implement new logic that fetches token
  from TokenService
- Add feature that fetches auth and refresh
  tokens for this service, using TokenService's
  initialization token.
