Understanding mappedBy in @OneToMany

The mappedBy attribute is used in a bidirectional relationship to indicate
which entity owns the foreign key column in the database.
	•	In a one-to-many (@OneToMany) relationship, the “one” side
	    does not own the foreign key.

	•	Instead, the “many” side owns the relationship because it stores
	    the foreign key in its table

TLDR
1.	The mappedBy side is the inverse side, meaning it does not have a foreign key
    column.
2.	The @JoinColumn is only needed on the side that owns the foreign key
    (the “many” side in @ManyToOne).
3.	The database schema should be normalized, meaning the “one” side doesn’t store
    references to the “many” side.
4.	Querying account.getTransactions() will work because Hibernate knows how to map
    them, even though there is no transactions column in the account table
