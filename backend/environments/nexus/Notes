Purpose of nexus: 
    Nexus is used to store internal libraries via a Maven-hosted repository. 
    It facilitates the containerization process by offering a centralized repository 
    for fetching and deploying libraries.

username: 
    - admin

How to access: 
    - Go to http://<host-name-or-ipAddress>:<port-specified>

Things to note:
	- Every client that is deploying to or pulling from the Nexus repository needs 
        a valid settings.xml file located at ~/.m2. (If it doesn't exist, create it.)
	- The settings.xml file needs to point to the server hosting the repository.


Newly created nexus repos:
    - Enter nexus container and obtain the default admin password
        cat /nexus-data/admin.password
    - Follow setup wizard
    - create a repository (maven2 hosted)
    - allow deploy w/ 'Allow Redeploy'
