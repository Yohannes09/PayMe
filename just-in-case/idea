Desired features:
    Working front end. (shouldn't be coupled with backend eventually)

    Ability for logged in users to sort the information (create a more complete banking app)
        - by date
        - by name


    Refactor repo and reduce repetitive code

    Separate concerns better

    More columns needed in the tables
