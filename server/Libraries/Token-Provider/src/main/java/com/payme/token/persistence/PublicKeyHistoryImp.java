/**
 * Default in-memory implementation of the {@link PublicKeyHistory} interface.
 * <p>
 * This class maintains a thread-safe, fixed-size queue of recent public keys used for
 * token verification. It automatically trims older keys once the limit is reached,
 * ensuring memory safety while allowing clients to verify signatures during key rotation.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is suitable for applications that need a lightweight and
 * in-process solution for maintaining public key history.
 * <p>
 * Thread-safe and ready for use as a Spring-managed singleton.
 *
 * <p><strong>Configuration:</strong> The maximum number of keys retained is set
 * via constructor and should fall between 3 and 20 keys.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> This implementation does not persist key history and will
 * reset on application restart.
